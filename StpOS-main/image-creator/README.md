# StpOs Image creator

This repo helps you understand how you can modify a base raspberry pi image into one used for the botball competition.

# Getting started

There are multiple base versions available here. Right now, these do exist:

- Debian Bookworm
- Debian Bullseye

The latest and therefore recommended version is the Debian Bookworm version.
The Bullseye version is deprecated and will not be updated anymore.

# Disclaimers

These steps and guides are heavily focused on you working on a Linux machine.
From my current understanding, you can't even do this on windows yet, don't know about macOS.

All steps shown here might be outdated or not functional 100%, so please be careful. If things are outdated, you can
always
look at [kipr/wombat-os](https://github.com/kipr/wombat-os/tree/main). This is the repo containing the instructions and
files for the original wombat image.
