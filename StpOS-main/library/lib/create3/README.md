# `iRobot速 Create速 3 robot ROS2 server and client library`

Holds a ROS2 C++ server for communicating with the iRobot速 Create速 3 robot and an associated client library for
communicating
with said server. The server can then be packaged into a Docker image, allowing the client to remain free of ROS2
dependencies.

The RPC between client and server is handled by Cap'n Proto.

## Dependencies

### Common

- C++ Compiler with C++17 support
- CMake >3.5

### Server

- ROS 2

## Building

```bash
cd create3
cmake -Bbuild
cmake --build build
```

### Building the Client with Docker

When building with Docker, run `build_docker.sh`. This will build the project using a docker container, where all
dependencies are installed and produce a .deb file, for later installation.

This will also 'cross-compile' the project for the arm64 architecture, which is the architecture of the KIPR Wombat.

The built binary will be placed in the `binaries` directory.

### Building the Server with Docker

The [create3_docker](https://github.com/kipr/create3_docker) repository contains the instructions for building the server
into a wombat compatible docker image.

#### Customizing the Docker Build

If the build is needed for a different platform, the `Dockerfile` can be modified to use a different base image.
Right now it uses `arm64v8/python:3.11.2-bullseye`, which is a arm64 image with python 3.11.2 installed.

### Build Options

- `-Dserver=ON|OFF` (Default: `ON`) - Controls whether the server is built.
- `-Dclient=ON|OFF` (Default: `ON`) - Controls whether the client library is built.
- `-Dcmder=ON|OFF` (Default: `ON`) - Controls whether the create3 CLI is built.
- `-Dtests=ON|OFF` (Default: `ON`) - Controls whether tests are generated that can be run with `ctest`.

For most scenarios:

- Use `-Dserver=OFF` for the client (eg. dev machine)
- Use `-Dclient=OFF -Dcmder=OFF` for the server (eg. Docker image)

Use `--parallel <n>` to build with multiple threads in `cmake --build build` step.

### Windows Support

To configure cmake for a windows build, replace `cmake -Bbuild` with:

```

cmake -Bbuild -GNinja -Dserver=OFF

```

The reminaing instructions are the same.

## Examples

Examples are configured to connect to a KIPR Wombat running the docker instance of the server. Users may want to change
the IP address in the examples to match their own setup.

Examples may be run after building by executing:

```bash
cd create3/build
./examples/<example_name>
```

## Tests

To run unit tests, execute:

```bash
cd create3/build
ctest
```
