title: Getting Started with LibStp
---

# LibStp

### Lego-inspired Botball Super Toolkit for Programming

---

## The Problem

### Repeated Reinvention

- Each year, teams had to rewrite common functionalities (e.g., line following).
- Resulted in wasted time and duplicated effort.

----

### Increasing Complexity

- Robots became more advanced, but so did the codebase.
- Managing the code became:
    - **Time-consuming**
    - **Difficult to maintain**
    - **Hard to understand**

----

### Lack of Standardization

- No unified approach across teams.
- Sharing and reusing code between teams was nearly impossible.

---

## The Idea

- Two robots last year: **create3** and **wombat**.
- Initially controlled using entirely different APIs.
- Team members with limited programming experience struggled to contribute effectively.

----

### A Unified Solution

- A **single high-level API**
- Abstracts away low-level robot details.
- Provides a unified interface for all supported robots.

----

### Goal

- Make the API **readable and usable** for beginners
- Still satisfy my special needs for **overengineering** üòÖ

---

## The Solution: LibStp

### What is LibStp?

- Stands for **"Library St. Poelten"** (Or is it "Lightweight but Seriously Terrific Programming"? ü§î)
- Designed to:
    - Simplify robotics programming.
    - Enable code reuse and collaboration across teams.

---

### Key Features

- High-Level API
- Python Supremacy üêç
- Beginner-Friendly (Not really, but I tried)

---

## Task: Drive forward for 3s, then backward for 3s

Here‚Äôs how you can achieve this in different ways:

---

## Barebone Kipr C API ü§ñ

```c
int main()
{
    motor(0, 100); // Move forward
    motor(3, 100);
    msleep(3000);

    motor(0, -100); // Move backward
    motor(3, -100);
    msleep(3000);

    return 0;
}
```

----

### Pros

- Simple and straightforward

### Cons

- üö´ Repetition
- üö´ Hard to read and maintain

---

## With OOP üßë‚Äçüíª

```python
left = Motor(0)
right = Motor(1)

left.set_velocity(1500)  # Forward
right.set_velocity(1500)
time.sleep(3)

left.set_velocity(-1500)  # Backward
right.set_velocity(-1500)
time.sleep(3)

stop_all_motors()
```

----

### Pros

- Cleaner structure

### Cons

- Still a bit repetitive üòÖ

---

## LibStp

```python
left = Motor(0)
right = Motor(1)

with TwoWheeledDevice(left, right) as device:
    device.drive_straight(for_seconds(3), Speed.Fastest)
    device.drive_straight(
        for_seconds(3),
        Speed.Fastest.backward()
    )
```

----

### Pros

- Intuitive methods
- Less boilerplate

### Cons

- Requires learning a new API
- Some concepts might be just an izzi bitty littly too overengineered ü§ì (You'll see)

----

Just as an example, the method `drive_straight` executes ~300 lines of code, including PID control,
motor synchronization, and error correction. ü§Ø

# Practical Usage

Time to get our hands dirty! üßº

----

## Prerequisites

The library comes preconfigured on the wombat. To write your own code, I recommend using PyCharm with an SSH Interpreter
on the robot (View PyCharm docs for more info).

----

### Creating a ~~_Backend_~~ Device

### What is a Device?

- A class that interfaces with the robot.
- Provides high-level methods to control the robot.
- Handles automatic calibration and more.

----

### Example: Device in Action

```python
left = Motor(0)
right = Motor(1)

with TwoWheeledDevice(left, right) as robot:
# Your code here
```

----

### Why Use the `with` Statement?

- Ensures proper cleanup after execution.
- Automatically handles:
    - Stopping motors.
    - Disabling servos.
    - Disposing threads.
    - Calibrating sensors.

---

## Most essential methods

- `drive_straight(condition, speed)`
- `rotate(condition, speed)`

---

## Conditions

Define when to stop executing a command.

----

### Undefined Conditions

Important: `Lerp` can't be used with them

- `while_true(lambda: x <= 5)` - Run until the lambda returns `False`
- `while_false(lambda: x <= 5)` - Run until the lambda returns `True`

----

### Defined Conditions

- `for_seconds(seconds)` - Time-based condition
- `for_distance(distance_cm)` - Distance-based condition
- `for_ccw_rotation(degrees)` - CCW Rotation-based condition
- `for_cw_rotation(degrees)` - CW Rotation-based condition

---

## Speeds

The library provides five speed levels:

- `Speed.Slowest`
- `Speed.Slow`
- `Speed.Medium`
- `Speed.Fast`
- `Speed.Fastest`

**Note:** Speeds are forward by default. To move backward, use the `backward()` method.

----

## Manually Configuring Speeds

`Speed` allows you to configure speeds manually:

```python
my_speed = Speed(
    forward_percent=0.1,  # 10% of max speed (~20 cm/s for two-wheeled)
    angular_percent=0.5  # 50% of max angular speed (~2.3 rad/s for two-wheeled)
)
```

**Note:** `drive_straight` as example only use `forward_percent`.

----

## Speedfunction

`drive_straight` as example accepts a constant speed or a function that returns a speed:

```python
robot.drive_straight(
    for_distance(10),
    lerp(Speed.Fastest, Speed.Slowest)
)
```

This makes the robot go from `Speed.Fastest` to `Speed.Slowest` over the course of the distance.

---

# Basics over, let's talk about some overengineering ü§ì

---

## Proper Architecture üèóÔ∏è

I found that it's best to separate your code into different modules:

- `main.py` - Entrypoint & Main Module
- `setup.py` - Module for pre-run setup
- `modules/` - Additional modules for specific tasks
- `definitions/` - Special folder housing definitions

----

## Modules

A module is:

- A python class that inherits from `Module`.
- Modules help keep the separation of concerns principle.
- Modules ideally call other high level methods.

----

## Definitions

There is a base definition. It's supposed to house all servo, motor, and sensor references.

A definition can be easily modified for specific tables with definition overrides.

---

# Example

Every concept is best explained with an example.

Look at the example code in the `examples` folder (Ideally the `examples/robot/gcer2024-create3` folder).

**Note**: The example code still uses the old api, but it should give you a good idea of how to structure your code.

----

## Example Code segment

```python
class Get5Habitats(Create3Module):
    def __init__(self, robot: RobotBackend,
                 definitions: Definitions):
        super().__init__("get_5_habitats",
                         robot, definitions)

    def run(self):
        self.robot.drive_straight(for_seconds(0.3),
                                  constant(Speed.Slowest))
        self.robot.rotate(for_cw_rotation(45),
                          constant(Speed.Fastest))
```

---

## Sensors

Many different sensor implementations are available:

- `AnalogSensor(port)`
- `DigitalSensor(port)` - is_clicked
- `DistanceSensor(port)` - get_distance (in cm)
- `LightSensor(port)` - is_on_black, wait_for_light
- IMUSensors (gyro, accel, mag, etc)

----

### Sensor Filtering

Multiple filters have been implemented. They try to reduce noise and make the sensor readings more reliable.

- `AvgFilter`
- `FirstOrderLowPassFilter`
- `MovingAverageFilter`
- ...

----

### Sensor Usage

```python
gyro_x = GyroXSensor(FirstOrderLowPassFilter(0.7))
gyro_y = GyroYSensor(FirstOrderLowPassFilter(0.7))
gyro_z = GyroZSensor(FirstOrderLowPassFilter(0.7))

wait_for_button_click()
while not is_button_clicked():
    x = gyro_x.get_value()
    y = gyro_y.get_value()
    z = gyro_z.get_value()
    print(f'X: {x}, Y: {y}, Z: {z}')
    time.sleep(0.1) 
```

---

## Actuators

Actuators are used to control the robot's movement.

---

### Motors

`Motor(port, reverse_polarity)`

----

### Motor Functions

- `set_velocity(velocity)` - -1500 - 1500
- `stop()` - Active braking
- `get_current_position_estimate()` - BackEMF
- ... (Docs)

---

### Servos

`Servo(port)`

----

### Servo Functions

- `set_position(position)` - 0 - 2047
- `enable()` - Enable the servo
- `disable()` - Disable the servo
- `slowly_set_position(position, speed, interpolation)` - Slowly set the servo position
- ... (Docs)

---

### Servo like Motor

`ServoLikeMotor(port, reverse_polarity)`

This is a motor that has the same functionality as a servo, but less accurate
